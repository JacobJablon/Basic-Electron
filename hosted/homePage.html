    <!-- Here we have a content security policy of CSP. CSP allows us to
         secure our client side by telling the underlying browser (electron
         just runs a chromium window after all) to not allow connections to
         resources that we don't specifically define. In this case, we can
         only connect to 'self' which is our electron app.

         CSP is crucially important in Electron applications, because unlike our
         browser apps, we are not in the browser sandbox. Electron apps have the
         ability to write to our hard drives, edit files, read files, etc.
         Therefore we want them to be very secure.
         
         If we wanted to load images or scripts from another domain, we would
         need to update the CSP to allow for that. Websites like this
         https://report-uri.com/home/generate allow for easy CSP generation.

    <!-- Here we are loading our homePageBundle.js. Note that we do not have
         any code written that "serves" this file. Normally in a web application
         with distinct client and server sides we need to statically host
         resources like our bundles and html pages. However, electron allows
         us to utilize the filesystem since everything is running locally on
         the machine.

         We can have an additional web server and make requests to it, but
         that would be a separate node project entirely.

    <!-- Loading new pages in electron is very similar to loading pages in
    a web browser. We simply need to navigate to them. Electron lets us
    load files straight from our hard drive so there is no need for us
    to write a server that serves these files.-->
